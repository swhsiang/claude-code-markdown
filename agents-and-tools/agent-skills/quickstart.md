This tutorial shows you how to use Agent Skills to create a PowerPoint presentation. You'll learn how to enable Skills, make a simple request, and access the generated file.
## 
Prerequisites
  * [Anthropic API key](https://platform.claude.com/settings/keys)
  * Python 3.7+ or curl installed
  * Basic familiarity with making API requests


## 
What are Agent Skills?
Pre-built Agent Skills extend Claude's capabilities with specialized expertise for tasks like creating documents, analyzing data, and processing files. Anthropic provides the following pre-built Agent Skills in the API:
  * **PowerPoint (pptx)** : Create and edit presentations
  * **Excel (xlsx)** : Create and analyze spreadsheets
  * **Word (docx)** : Create and edit documents
  * **PDF (pdf)** : Generate PDF documents


**Want to create custom Skills?** See the [Agent Skills Cookbook](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/skills-notebooks-01-skills-introduction) for examples of building your own Skills with domain-specific expertise.
## 
Step 1: List available Skills
First, let's see what Skills are available. We'll use the Skills API to list all Anthropic-managed Skills:
Python
```
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# List Anthropic-managed Skills
skills = client.beta.skills.list(
    source="anthropic",
    betas=["skills-2025-10-02"]


for skill in skills.data:
    print(f"{skill.id}: {skill.display_title}")
```

You see the following Skills: `pptx`, `xlsx`, `docx`, and `pdf`.
This API returns each Skill's metadata: its name and description. Claude loads this metadata at startup to know what Skills are available. This is the first level of **progressive disclosure** , where Claude discovers Skills without loading their full instructions yet.
## 
Step 2: Create a presentation
Now we'll use the PowerPoint Skill to create a presentation about renewable energy. We specify Skills using the `container` parameter in the Messages API:
Python
```
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Create a message with the PowerPoint Skill
response = client.beta.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    max_tokens=4096,
    betas=["code-execution-2025-08-25", "skills-2025-10-02"],
    container={
        "skills": [

                "type": "anthropic",
                "skill_id": "pptx",
                "version": "latest"


    },
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Create a presentation about renewable energy with 5 slides"
    }],
    tools=[{
        "type": "code_execution_20250825",
        "name": "code_execution"
    }]


print(response.content)
```

Let's break down what each part does:
  * **`container.skills`**: Specifies which Skills Claude can use
  * **`type: "anthropic"`**: Indicates this is an Anthropic-managed Skill
  * **`skill_id: "pptx"`**: The PowerPoint Skill identifier
  * **`version: "latest"`**: The Skill version set to the most recently published
  * **`tools`**: Enables code execution (required for Skills)
  * **Beta headers** : `code-execution-2025-08-25` and `skills-2025-10-02`


When you make this request, Claude automatically matches your task to the relevant Skill. Since you asked for a presentation, Claude determines the PowerPoint Skill is relevant and loads its full instructions: the second level of progressive disclosure. Then Claude executes the Skill's code to create your presentation.
## 
Step 3: Download the created file
The presentation was created in the code execution container and saved as a file. The response includes a file reference with a file ID. Extract the file ID and download it using the Files API:
Python
```
# Extract file ID from response
file_id = None
for block in response.content:
    if block.type == 'tool_use' and block.name == 'code_execution':
        # File ID is in the tool result
        for result_block in block.content:
            if hasattr(result_block, 'file_id'):
                file_id = result_block.file_id
                break

if file_id:
    # Download the file
    file_content = client.beta.files.download(
        file_id=file_id,
        betas=["files-api-2025-04-14"]


    # Save to disk
    with open("renewable_energy.pptx", "wb") as f:
        file_content.write_to_file(f.name)

    print(f"Presentation saved to renewable_energy.pptx")
```

For complete details on working with generated files, see the [code execution tool documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#retrieve-generated-files).
