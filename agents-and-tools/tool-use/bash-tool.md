The bash tool enables Claude to execute shell commands in a persistent bash session, allowing system operations, script execution, and command-line automation.
## 
Overview
The bash tool provides Claude with:
  * Persistent bash session that maintains state
  * Ability to run any shell command
  * Access to environment variables and working directory
  * Command chaining and scripting capabilities


## 
Model compatibility
Model | Tool Version  
---|---  
Claude 4 models and Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations)) | `bash_20250124`  
Older tool versions are not guaranteed to be backwards-compatible with newer models. Always use the tool version that corresponds to your model version.
## 
Use cases
  * **Development workflows** : Run build commands, tests, and development tools
  * **System automation** : Execute scripts, manage files, automate tasks
  * **Data processing** : Process files, run analysis scripts, manage datasets
  * **Environment setup** : Install packages, configure environments


## 
Quick start
Python
```
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[

            "type": "bash_20250124",
            "name": "bash"

    ],
    messages=[
"role": "user", "content": "List all Python files in the current directory."}


```

## 
How it works
The bash tool maintains a persistent session:
  1. Claude determines what command to run
  2. You execute the command in a bash shell
  3. Return the output (stdout and stderr) to Claude
  4. Session state persists between commands (environment variables, working directory)


## 
Parameters
Parameter | Required | Description  
---|---|---  
`command` | Yes* | The bash command to run  
`restart` | No | Set to `true` to restart the bash session  
*Required unless using `restart`
### Example usage
## 
Example: Multi-step automation
Claude can chain commands to complete complex tasks:
```
# User request
"Install the requests library and create a simple Python script that fetches a joke from an API, then run it."

# Claude's tool uses:
# 1. Install package
{"command": "pip install requests"}

# 2. Create script
{"command": "cat > fetch_joke.py << 'EOF'\nimport requests\nresponse = requests.get('https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke')\njoke = response.json()\nprint(f\"Setup: {joke['setup']}\")\nprint(f\"Punchline: {joke['punchline']}\")\nEOF"}

# 3. Run script
{"command": "python fetch_joke.py"}
```

The session maintains state between commands, so files created in step 2 are available in step 3.
## 
Implement the bash tool
The bash tool is implemented as a schema-less tool. When using this tool, you don't need to provide an input schema as with other tools; the schema is built into Claude's model and can't be modified.
  1. 1
Set up a bash environment
Create a persistent bash session that Claude can interact with:
```
import subprocess
import threading
import queue

class BashSession:
    def __init__(self):
        self.process = subprocess.Popen(
'/bin/bash'],
            stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
            text=True,
            bufsize=0

        self.output_queue = queue.Queue()
        self.error_queue = queue.Queue()
        self._start_readers()
```

  2. 2
Handle command execution
Create a function to execute commands and capture output:
```
def execute_command(self, command):
    # Send command to bash
    self.process.stdin.write(command + '\n')
    self.process.stdin.flush()

    # Capture output with timeout
    output = self._read_output(timeout=10)
    return output
```

  3. 3
Process Claude's tool calls
Extract and execute commands from Claude's responses:
```
for content in response.content:
    if content.type == "tool_use" and content.name == "bash":
        if content.input.get("restart"):
            bash_session.restart()
            result = "Bash session restarted"
        else:
            command = content.input.get("command")
            result = bash_session.execute_command(command)

        # Return result to Claude
        tool_result = {
            "type": "tool_result",
            "tool_use_id": content.id,
            "content": result

```

  4. 4
Implement safety measures
Add validation and restrictions:
```
def validate_command(command):
    # Block dangerous commands
    dangerous_patterns = ['rm -rf /', 'format', ':(){:|:&};:']
    for pattern in dangerous_patterns:
        if pattern in command:
            return False, f"Command contains dangerous pattern: {pattern}"

    # Add more validation as needed
    return True, None
```



### 
Handle errors
When implementing the bash tool, handle various error scenarios:
### Command execution timeout
### Command not found
### Permission denied
### 
Follow implementation best practices
### Use command timeouts
### Maintain session state
### Handle large outputs
### Log all commands
### Sanitize outputs
## 
Security
The bash tool provides direct system access. Implement these essential safety measures:
  * Running in isolated environments (Docker/VM)
  * Implementing command filtering and allowlists
  * Setting resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)
  * Logging all executed commands


### 
Key recommendations
  * Use `ulimit` to set resource constraints
  * Filter dangerous commands (`sudo`, `rm -rf`, etc.)
  * Run with minimal user permissions
  * Monitor and log all command execution


## 
Pricing
The bash tool adds **245 input tokens** to your API calls.
Additional tokens are consumed by:
  * Command outputs (stdout/stderr)
  * Error messages
  * Large file contents


See [tool use pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview#pricing) for complete pricing details.
## 
Common patterns
### 
Development workflows
  * Running tests: `pytest && coverage report`
  * Building projects: `npm install && npm run build`
  * Git operations: `git status && git add . && git commit -m "message"`


### 
File operations
  * Processing data: `wc -l *.csv && ls -lh *.csv`
  * Searching files: `find . -name "*.py" | xargs grep "pattern"`
  * Creating backups: `tar -czf backup.tar.gz ./data`


### 
System tasks
  * Checking resources: `df -h && free -m`
  * Process management: `ps aux | grep python`
  * Environment setup: `export PATH=$PATH:/new/path && echo $PATH`


## 
Limitations
  * **No interactive commands** : Cannot handle `vim`, `less`, or password prompts
  * **No GUI applications** : Command-line only
  * **Session scope** : Persists within conversation, lost between API calls
  * **Output limits** : Large outputs may be truncated
  * **No streaming** : Results returned after completion


## 
Combining with other tools
The bash tool is most powerful when combined with the [text editor](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/text-editor-tool) and other tools.
