Claude can use an Anthropic-defined text editor tool to view and modify text files, helping you debug, fix, and improve your code or other text documents. This allows Claude to directly interact with your files, providing hands-on assistance rather than just suggesting changes.
## 
Model compatibility
Model | Tool Version  
---|---  
Claude 4.x models | `text_editor_20250728`  
Claude Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations)) | `text_editor_20250124`  
The `text_editor_20250728` tool for Claude 4 models does not include the `undo_edit` command. If you require this functionality, you'll need to use Claude Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations)).
Older tool versions are not guaranteed to be backwards-compatible with newer models. Always use the tool version that corresponds to your model version.
## 
When to use the text editor tool
Some examples of when to use the text editor tool are:
  * **Code debugging** : Have Claude identify and fix bugs in your code, from syntax errors to logic issues.
  * **Code refactoring** : Let Claude improve your code structure, readability, and performance through targeted edits.
  * **Documentation generation** : Ask Claude to add docstrings, comments, or README files to your codebase.
  * **Test creation** : Have Claude create unit tests for your code based on its understanding of the implementation.


## 
Use the text editor tool
Claude 4
Claude Sonnet 3.7
Provide the text editor tool (named `str_replace_based_edit_tool`) to Claude using the Messages API.
You can optionally specify a `max_characters` parameter to control truncation when viewing large files.
`max_characters` is only compatible with `text_editor_20250728` and later versions of the text editor tool.
Shell
```

```

The text editor tool can be used in the following way:
  1. 1
Provide Claude with the text editor tool and a user prompt
     * Include the text editor tool in your API request
     * Provide a user prompt that may require examining or modifying files, such as "Can you fix the syntax error in my code?"
  2. 2
Claude uses the tool to examine files or directories
     * Claude assesses what it needs to look at and uses the `view` command to examine file contents or list directory contents
     * The API response will contain a `tool_use` content block with the `view` command
  3. 3
Execute the view command and return results
     * Extract the file or directory path from Claude's tool use request
     * Read the file's contents or list the directory contents
     * If a `max_characters` parameter was specified in the tool configuration, truncate the file contents to that length
     * Return the results to Claude by continuing the conversation with a new `user` message containing a `tool_result` content block
  4. 4
Claude uses the tool to modify files
     * After examining the file or directory, Claude may use a command such as `str_replace` to make changes or `insert` to add text at a specific line number.
     * If Claude uses the `str_replace` command, Claude constructs a properly formatted tool use request with the old text and new text to replace it with
  5. 5
Execute the edit and return results
     * Extract the file path, old text, and new text from Claude's tool use request
     * Perform the text replacement in the file
     * Return the results to Claude
  6. 6
Claude provides its analysis and explanation
     * After examining and possibly editing the files, Claude provides a complete explanation of what it found and what changes it made


### 
Text editor tool commands
The text editor tool supports several commands for viewing and modifying files:
#### 
view
The `view` command allows Claude to examine the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory. It can read the entire file or a specific range of lines.
Parameters:
  * `command`: Must be "view"
  * `path`: The path to the file or directory to view
  * `view_range` (optional): An array of two integers specifying the start and end line numbers to view. Line numbers are 1-indexed, and -1 for the end line means read to the end of the file. This parameter only applies when viewing files, not directories.


### Example view commands
#### 
str_replace
The `str_replace` command allows Claude to replace a specific string in a file with a new string. This is used for making precise edits.
Parameters:
  * `command`: Must be "str_replace"
  * `path`: The path to the file to modify
  * `old_str`: The text to replace (must match exactly, including whitespace and indentation)
  * `new_str`: The new text to insert in place of the old text


### Example str_replace command
#### 
create
The `create` command allows Claude to create a new file with specified content.
Parameters:
  * `command`: Must be "create"
  * `path`: The path where the new file should be created
  * `file_text`: The content to write to the new file


### Example create command
#### 
insert
The `insert` command allows Claude to insert text at a specific location in a file.
Parameters:
  * `command`: Must be "insert"
  * `path`: The path to the file to modify
  * `insert_line`: The line number after which to insert the text (0 for beginning of file)
  * `insert_text`: The text to insert


### Example insert command
#### 
undo_edit
The `undo_edit` command allows Claude to revert the last edit made to a file.
This command is only available in Claude Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations)). It is not supported in Claude 4 models using the `text_editor_20250728`.
Parameters:
  * `command`: Must be "undo_edit"
  * `path`: The path to the file whose last edit should be undone


### Example undo_edit command

Example: Fixing a syntax error with the text editor tool
Claude 4
Claude Sonnet 3.7
This example demonstrates how Claude 4 models use the text editor tool to fix a syntax error in a Python file.
First, your application provides Claude with the text editor tool and a prompt to fix a syntax error:
Shell
```
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "tools": [

        "type": "text_editor_20250728",
        "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool"

    ],
    "messages": [

        "role": "user",
        "content": "There'\''s a syntax error in my primes.py file. Can you help me fix it?"


  }'
```

Claude will use the text editor tool first to view the file:
```

  "id": "msg_01XAbCDeFgHiJkLmNoPQrStU",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "stop_reason": "tool_use",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [

      "type": "text",
      "text": "I'll help you fix the syntax error in your primes.py file. First, let me take a look at the file to identify the issue."
    },

      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStU",
      "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool",
      "input": {
        "command": "view",
        "path": "primes.py"




```

Your application should then read the file and return its contents to Claude:
Shell
```
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \

  }'
```

**Line numbers**
In the example above, the `view` tool result includes file contents with line numbers prepended to each line (e.g., "1: def is_prime(n):"). Line numbers are not required, but they are essential for successfully using the `view_range` parameter to examine specific sections of files and the `insert_line` parameter to add content at precise locations.
Claude will identify the syntax error and use the `str_replace` command to fix it:
```

  "id": "msg_01VwXyZAbCdEfGhIjKlMnO",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "stop_reason": "tool_use",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [

      "type": "text",
      "text": "I found the syntax error in your primes.py file. In the `get_primes` function, there is a missing colon (:) at the end of the for loop line. Let me fix that for you."
    },

      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01PqRsTuVwXyZAbCdEfGh",
      "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool",
      "input": {
        "command": "str_replace",
        "path": "primes.py",
        "old_str": "    for num in range(2, limit + 1)",
        "new_str": "    for num in range(2, limit + 1):"




```

Your application should then make the edit and return the result:
Python
```
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[

            "type": "text_editor_20250728",
            "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool"

    ],
    messages=[
        # Previous messages...

            "role": "assistant",
            "content": [

                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "I found the syntax error in your primes.py file. In the `get_primes` function, there is a missing colon (:) at the end of the for loop line. Let me fix that for you."


                    "type": "tool_use",
                    "id": "toolu_01PqRsTuVwXyZAbCdEfGh",
                    "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool",
                    "input": {
                        "command": "str_replace",
                        "path": "primes.py",
                        "old_str": "    for num in range(2, limit + 1)",
                        "new_str": "    for num in range(2, limit + 1):"



        },

            "role": "user",
            "content": [

                    "type": "tool_result",

                    "content": "Successfully replaced text at exactly one location."





```

Finally, Claude will provide a complete explanation of the fix:
```

  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "stop_reason": "end_turn",

      "text": "I've fixed the syntax error in your primes.py file. The issue was in the `get_primes` function at line 19. There was a missing colon (:) at the end of the for loop line.\n\nHere's what I changed:\n\nFrom:\n```python\nfor num in range(2, limit + 1)\n```\n\nTo:\n```python\nfor num in range(2, limit + 1):\n```\n\nIn Python, a colon is required at the end of statements that start a new code block, such as for loops, if statements, function definitions, etc. Without the colon, Python raises a syntax error because it doesn't know where the code block begins.\n\nYour code should now run correctly. The function will properly generate a list of prime numbers up to the specified limit."



```

## 
Implement the text editor tool
The text editor tool is implemented as a schema-less tool. When using this tool, you don't need to provide an input schema as with other tools; the schema is built into Claude's model and can't be modified.
The tool type depends on the model version:
  * **Claude 4** : `type: "text_editor_20250728"`
  * **Claude Sonnet 3.7** : `type: "text_editor_20250124"`


  1. 1
Initialize your editor implementation
Create helper functions to handle file operations like reading, writing, and modifying files. Consider implementing backup functionality to recover from mistakes.
  2. 2
Handle editor tool calls
Create a function that processes tool calls from Claude based on the command type:
```
def handle_editor_tool(tool_call, model_version):
    input_params = tool_call.input
    command = input_params.get('command', '')
    file_path = input_params.get('path', '')

    if command == 'view':
        # Read and return file contents
        pass
    elif command == 'str_replace':
        # Replace text in file
        pass
    elif command == 'create':
        # Create new file
        pass
    elif command == 'insert':
        # Insert text at location
        pass
    elif command == 'undo_edit':
        # Check if it's a Claude 4 model
        if 'str_replace_based_edit_tool' in model_version:
            return {"error": "undo_edit command is not supported in Claude 4"}
        # Restore from backup for Claude 3.7
        pass
```

  3. 3
Implement security measures
Add validation and security checks:
     * Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
     * Create backups before making changes
     * Handle errors gracefully
     * Implement permissions checks
  4. 4
Process Claude's responses
Extract and handle tool calls from Claude's responses:
```
# Process tool use in Claude's response
for content in response.content:
    if content.type == "tool_use":
        # Execute the tool based on command
        result = handle_editor_tool(content)

        # Return result to Claude
        tool_result = {
            "type": "tool_result",
            "tool_use_id": content.id,
            "content": result

```



When implementing the text editor tool, keep in mind:
  1. **Security** : The tool has access to your local filesystem, so implement proper security measures.
  2. **Backup** : Always create backups before allowing edits to important files.
  3. **Validation** : Validate all inputs to prevent unintended changes.
  4. **Unique matching** : Make sure replacements match exactly one location to avoid unintended edits.


### 
Handle errors
When using the text editor tool, various errors may occur. Here is guidance on how to handle them:
### File not found
### Multiple matches for replacement
### No matches for replacement
### Permission errors
### 
Follow implementation best practices
### Provide clear context
### Be explicit about file paths
### Create backups before editing
### Handle unique text replacement carefully
### Verify changes
## 
Pricing and token usage
The text editor tool uses the same pricing structure as other tools used with Claude. It follows the standard input and output token pricing based on the Claude model you're using.
In addition to the base tokens, the following additional input tokens are needed for the text editor tool:
Tool | Additional input tokens  
---|---  
`text_editor_20250429` (Claude 4.x) | 700 tokens  
`text_editor_20250124` (Claude Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations))) | 700 tokens  
For more detailed information about tool pricing, see [Tool use pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview#pricing).
## 
Integrate the text editor tool with other tools
The text editor tool can be used alongside other Claude tools. When combining tools, ensure you:
  * Match the tool version with the model you're using
  * Account for the additional token usage for all tools included in your request

## 
Use the text editor tool
Claude 4
Claude Sonnet 3.7
Provide the text editor tool (named `str_replace_based_edit_tool`) to Claude using the Messages API.
You can optionally specify a `max_characters` parameter to control truncation when viewing large files.
`max_characters` is only compatible with `text_editor_20250728` and later versions of the text editor tool.

The text editor tool can be used in the following way:
  1. 1
Provide Claude with the text editor tool and a user prompt
     * Include the text editor tool in your API request
     * Provide a user prompt that may require examining or modifying files, such as "Can you fix the syntax error in my code?"
  2. 2
Claude uses the tool to examine files or directories
     * Claude assesses what it needs to look at and uses the `view` command to examine file contents or list directory contents
     * The API response will contain a `tool_use` content block with the `view` command
  3. 3
Execute the view command and return results
     * Extract the file or directory path from Claude's tool use request
     * Read the file's contents or list the directory contents
     * If a `max_characters` parameter was specified in the tool configuration, truncate the file contents to that length
     * Return the results to Claude by continuing the conversation with a new `user` message containing a `tool_result` content block
  4. 4
Claude uses the tool to modify files
     * After examining the file or directory, Claude may use a command such as `str_replace` to make changes or `insert` to add text at a specific line number.
     * If Claude uses the `str_replace` command, Claude constructs a properly formatted tool use request with the old text and new text to replace it with
  5. 5
Execute the edit and return results
     * Extract the file path, old text, and new text from Claude's tool use request
     * Perform the text replacement in the file
     * Return the results to Claude
  6. 6
Claude provides its analysis and explanation
     * After examining and possibly editing the files, Claude provides a complete explanation of what it found and what changes it made


### 
Text editor tool commands
The text editor tool supports several commands for viewing and modifying files:
#### 
view
The `view` command allows Claude to examine the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory. It can read the entire file or a specific range of lines.
Parameters:
  * `command`: Must be "view"
  * `path`: The path to the file or directory to view
  * `view_range` (optional): An array of two integers specifying the start and end line numbers to view. Line numbers are 1-indexed, and -1 for the end line means read to the end of the file. This parameter only applies when viewing files, not directories.


### Example view commands
#### 
str_replace
The `str_replace` command allows Claude to replace a specific string in a file with a new string. This is used for making precise edits.
Parameters:
  * `command`: Must be "str_replace"
  * `path`: The path to the file to modify
  * `old_str`: The text to replace (must match exactly, including whitespace and indentation)
  * `new_str`: The new text to insert in place of the old text


### Example str_replace command
#### 
create
The `create` command allows Claude to create a new file with specified content.
Parameters:
  * `command`: Must be "create"
  * `path`: The path where the new file should be created
  * `file_text`: The content to write to the new file


### Example create command
#### 
insert
The `insert` command allows Claude to insert text at a specific location in a file.
Parameters:
  * `command`: Must be "insert"
  * `path`: The path to the file to modify
  * `insert_line`: The line number after which to insert the text (0 for beginning of file)
  * `insert_text`: The text to insert


### Example insert command
#### 
undo_edit
The `undo_edit` command allows Claude to revert the last edit made to a file.
This command is only available in Claude Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations)). It is not supported in Claude 4 models using the `text_editor_20250728`.
Parameters:
  * `command`: Must be "undo_edit"
  * `path`: The path to the file whose last edit should be undone


### Example undo_edit command

Example: Fixing a syntax error with the text editor tool
Claude 4
Claude Sonnet 3.7
This example demonstrates how Claude 4 models use the text editor tool to fix a syntax error in a Python file.
First, your application provides Claude with the text editor tool and a prompt to fix a syntax error:
Shell
```
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "tools": [

        "type": "text_editor_20250728",
        "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool"

    ],
    "messages": [

        "role": "user",
        "content": "There'\''s a syntax error in my primes.py file. Can you help me fix it?"


  }'
```

Claude will use the text editor tool first to view the file:
```

  "id": "msg_01XAbCDeFgHiJkLmNoPQrStU",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "stop_reason": "tool_use",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [

      "type": "text",
      "text": "I'll help you fix the syntax error in your primes.py file. First, let me take a look at the file to identify the issue."
    },

      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStU",
      "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool",
      "input": {
        "command": "view",
        "path": "primes.py"




```

Your application should then read the file and return its contents to Claude:
Shell
```
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "tools": [

        "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool"

    ],
    "messages": [

        "role": "user",
        "content": "There'\''s a syntax error in my primes.py file. Can you help me fix it?"
      },

            "role": "assistant",
            "content": [

                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "I'\''ll help you fix the syntax error in your primes.py file. First, let me take a look at the file to identify the issue."


                    "type": "tool_use",
                    "id": "toolu_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStU",

                    "input": {
                        "command": "view",
                        "path": "primes.py"



        },

            "role": "user",
            "content": [

                    "type": "tool_result",
                    "tool_use_id": "toolu_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStU",
                    "content": "1: def is_prime(n):\n2:     \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n3:     if n <= 1:\n4:         return False\n5:     if n <= 3:\n6:         return True\n7:     if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n8:         return False\n9:     i = 5\n10:     while i * i <= n:\n11:         if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n12:             return False\n13:         i += 6\n14:     return True\n15: \n16: def get_primes(limit):\n17:     \"\"\"Generate a list of prime numbers up to the given limit.\"\"\"\n18:     primes = []\n19:     for num in range(2, limit + 1)\n20:         if is_prime(num):\n21:             primes.append(num)\n22:     return primes\n23: \n24: def main():\n25:     \"\"\"Main function to demonstrate prime number generation.\"\"\"\n26:     limit = 100\n27:     prime_list = get_primes(limit)\n28:     print(f\"Prime numbers up to {limit}:\")\n29:     print(prime_list)\n30:     print(f\"Found {len(prime_list)} prime numbers.\")\n31: \n32: if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n33:     main()"




  }'
```

**Line numbers**
In the example above, the `view` tool result includes file contents with line numbers prepended to each line (e.g., "1: def is_prime(n):"). Line numbers are not required, but they are essential for successfully using the `view_range` parameter to examine specific sections of files and the `insert_line` parameter to add content at precise locations.
Claude will identify the syntax error and use the `str_replace` command to fix it:
```

  "id": "msg_01VwXyZAbCdEfGhIjKlMnO",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "stop_reason": "tool_use",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [

      "type": "text",
      "text": "I found the syntax error in your primes.py file. In the `get_primes` function, there is a missing colon (:) at the end of the for loop line. Let me fix that for you."
    },

      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01PqRsTuVwXyZAbCdEfGh",
      "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool",
      "input": {
        "command": "str_replace",
        "path": "primes.py",
        "old_str": "    for num in range(2, limit + 1)",
        "new_str": "    for num in range(2, limit + 1):"




```

Your application should then make the edit and return the result:
Python
```
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[

            "type": "text_editor_20250728",
            "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool"

    ],
    messages=[
        # Previous messages...

            "role": "assistant",
            "content": [

                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "I found the syntax error in your primes.py file. In the `get_primes` function, there is a missing colon (:) at the end of the for loop line. Let me fix that for you."


                    "type": "tool_use",
                    "id": "toolu_01PqRsTuVwXyZAbCdEfGh",
                    "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool",
                    "input": {
                        "command": "str_replace",
                        "path": "primes.py",
                        "old_str": "    for num in range(2, limit + 1)",
                        "new_str": "    for num in range(2, limit + 1):"



        },

            "role": "user",
            "content": [

                    "type": "tool_result",
                    "tool_use_id": "toolu_01PqRsTuVwXyZAbCdEfGh",
                    "content": "Successfully replaced text at exactly one location."





```

Finally, Claude will provide a complete explanation of the fix:
```

  "id": "msg_01IjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYzAb",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "stop_reason": "end_turn",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [

      "type": "text",
      "text": "I've fixed the syntax error in your primes.py file. The issue was in the `get_primes` function at line 19. There was a missing colon (:) at the end of the for loop line.\n\nHere's what I changed:\n\nFrom:\n```python\nfor num in range(2, limit + 1)\n```\n\nTo:\n```python\nfor num in range(2, limit + 1):\n```\n\nIn Python, a colon is required at the end of statements that start a new code block, such as for loops, if statements, function definitions, etc. Without the colon, Python raises a syntax error because it doesn't know where the code block begins.\n\nYour code should now run correctly. The function will properly generate a list of prime numbers up to the specified limit."



```

## 
Implement the text editor tool
The text editor tool is implemented as a schema-less tool. When using this tool, you don't need to provide an input schema as with other tools; the schema is built into Claude's model and can't be modified.
The tool type depends on the model version:
  * **Claude 4** : `type: "text_editor_20250728"`
  * **Claude Sonnet 3.7** : `type: "text_editor_20250124"`


  1. 1
Initialize your editor implementation
Create helper functions to handle file operations like reading, writing, and modifying files. Consider implementing backup functionality to recover from mistakes.
  2. 2
Handle editor tool calls
Create a function that processes tool calls from Claude based on the command type:
```
def handle_editor_tool(tool_call, model_version):
    input_params = tool_call.input
    command = input_params.get('command', '')
    file_path = input_params.get('path', '')

    if command == 'view':
        # Read and return file contents
        pass
    elif command == 'str_replace':
        # Replace text in file
        pass
    elif command == 'create':
        # Create new file
        pass
    elif command == 'insert':
        # Insert text at location
        pass
    elif command == 'undo_edit':
        # Check if it's a Claude 4 model
        if 'str_replace_based_edit_tool' in model_version:
            return {"error": "undo_edit command is not supported in Claude 4"}
        # Restore from backup for Claude 3.7
        pass
```

  3. 3
Implement security measures
Add validation and security checks:
     * Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
     * Create backups before making changes
     * Handle errors gracefully
     * Implement permissions checks
  4. 4
Process Claude's responses
Extract and handle tool calls from Claude's responses:
```
# Process tool use in Claude's response
for content in response.content:
    if content.type == "tool_use":
        # Execute the tool based on command
        result = handle_editor_tool(content)

        # Return result to Claude
        tool_result = {
            "type": "tool_result",
            "tool_use_id": content.id,
            "content": result

```



When implementing the text editor tool, keep in mind:
  1. **Security** : The tool has access to your local filesystem, so implement proper security measures.
  2. **Backup** : Always create backups before allowing edits to important files.
  3. **Validation** : Validate all inputs to prevent unintended changes.
  4. **Unique matching** : Make sure replacements match exactly one location to avoid unintended edits.


### 
Handle errors
When using the text editor tool, various errors may occur. Here is guidance on how to handle them:
### File not found
### Multiple matches for replacement
### No matches for replacement
### Permission errors
### 
Follow implementation best practices
### Provide clear context
### Be explicit about file paths
### Create backups before editing
### Handle unique text replacement carefully
### Verify changes
## 
Pricing and token usage
The text editor tool uses the same pricing structure as other tools used with Claude. It follows the standard input and output token pricing based on the Claude model you're using.
In addition to the base tokens, the following additional input tokens are needed for the text editor tool:
Tool | Additional input tokens  
---|---  
`text_editor_20250429` (Claude 4.x) | 700 tokens  
`text_editor_20250124` (Claude Sonnet 3.7 ([deprecated](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations))) | 700 tokens  
For more detailed information about tool pricing, see [Tool use pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview#pricing).
## 
Integrate the text editor tool with other tools
The text editor tool can be used alongside other Claude tools. When combining tools, ensure you:
  * Match the tool version with the model you're using
  * Account for the additional token usage for all tools included in your request
