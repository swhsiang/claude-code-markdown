Overview
The Claude Agent SDK supports two distinct input modes for interacting with agents:
  * **Streaming Input Mode** (Default & Recommended) - A persistent, interactive session
  * **Single Message Input** - One-shot queries that use session state and resuming


This guide explains the differences, benefits, and use cases for each mode to help you choose the right approach for your application.
## 
Streaming Input Mode (Recommended)
Streaming input mode is the **preferred** way to use the Claude Agent SDK. It provides full access to the agent's capabilities and enables rich, interactive experiences.
It allows the agent to operate as a long lived process that takes in user input, handles interruptions, surfaces permission requests, and handles session management.
### 
How It Works
### 
Benefits
Image Uploads
Attach images directly to messages for visual analysis and understanding
Queued Messages
Send multiple messages that process sequentially, with ability to interrupt
Tool Integration
Full access to all tools and custom MCP servers during the session
Hooks Support
Use lifecycle hooks to customize behavior at various points
Real-time Feedback
See responses as they're generated, not just final results
Context Persistence
Maintain conversation context across multiple turns naturally
### 
Implementation Example
TypeScript
```
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";
import { readFileSync } from "fs";

async function* generateMessages() {
  // First message
  yield {
    type: "user" as const,
    message: {
      role: "user" as const,
      content: "Analyze this codebase for security issues"

  };

  // Wait for conditions or user input
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));

  // Follow-up with image
  yield {
    type: "user" as const,
    message: {
      role: "user" as const,
      content: [

          type: "text",
          text: "Review this architecture diagram"
        },

          type: "image",
          source: {
            type: "base64",
            media_type: "image/png",
            data: readFileSync("diagram.png", "base64")




  };


// Process streaming responses
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: generateMessages(),
  options: {
    maxTurns: 10,
    allowedTools: ["Read", "Grep"]

})) {
  if (message.type === "result") {
    console.log(message.result);


```

## 
Single Message Input
Single message input is simpler but more limited.
### 
When to Use Single Message Input
Use single message input when:
  * You need a one-shot response
  * You do not need image attachments, hooks, etc.
  * You need to operate in a stateless environment, such as a lambda function


### 
Limitations
Single message input mode does **not** support:
  * Direct image attachments in messages
  * Dynamic message queueing
  * Real-time interruption
  * Hook integration
  * Natural multi-turn conversations


### 
Implementation Example
TypeScript
```
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

// Simple one-shot query
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Explain the authentication flow",
  options: {
    maxTurns: 1,
    allowedTools: ["Read", "Grep"]

})) {
  if (message.type === "result") {
    console.log(message.result);



// Continue conversation with session management
for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Now explain the authorization process",
  options: {
    continue: true,
    maxTurns: 1

})) {
  if (message.type === "result") {
    console.log(message.result);
