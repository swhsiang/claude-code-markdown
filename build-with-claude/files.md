The Files API lets you upload and manage files to use with the Claude API without re-uploading content with each request. This is particularly useful when using the [code execution tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool) to provide inputs (e.g. datasets and documents) and then download outputs (e.g. charts). You can also use the Files API to prevent having to continually re-upload frequently used documents and images across multiple API calls. You can [explore the API reference directly](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/files-create), in addition to this guide.
The Files API is currently in beta. Please reach out through our [feedback form](https://forms.gle/tisHyierGwgN4DUE9) to share your experience with the Files API.
## 
Supported models
Referencing a `file_id` in a Messages request is supported in all models that support the given file type. For example, [images](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision) are supported in all Claude 3+ models, [PDFs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support) in all Claude 3.5+ models, and [various other file types](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#supported-file-types) for the code execution tool in Claude Haiku 4.5 plus all Claude 3.7+ models.
The Files API is currently not supported on Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI.
## 
How the Files API works
The Files API provides a simple create-once, use-many-times approach for working with files:
  * **Upload files** to our secure storage and receive a unique `file_id`
  * **Download files** that are created from skills or the code execution tool
  * **Reference files** in [Messages](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages) requests using the `file_id` instead of re-uploading content
  * **Manage your files** with list, retrieve, and delete operations


## 
How to use the Files API
To use the Files API, you'll need to include the beta feature header: `anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14`.
### 
Uploading a file
Upload a file to be referenced in future API calls:
Shell
```
curl -X POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/document.pdf"
```

The response from uploading a file will include:
```

  "id": "file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w",
  "type": "file",
  "filename": "document.pdf",
  "mime_type": "application/pdf",
  "size_bytes": 1024000,
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "downloadable": false

```

### 
Using a file in messages
Once uploaded, reference the file using its `file_id`:
Shell
```
curl -X POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "messages": [

        "role": "user",
        "content": [

            "type": "text",
            "text": "Please summarize this document for me."          
          },

            "type": "document",
            "source": {
              "type": "file",
              "file_id": "file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w"





  }'
```

### 
File types and content blocks
The Files API supports different file types that correspond to different content block types:
File Type | MIME Type | Content Block Type | Use Case  
---|---|---|---  
PDF | `application/pdf` | `document` | Text analysis, document processing  
Plain text | `text/plain` | `document` | Text analysis, processing  
Images |  `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp` | `image` | Image analysis, visual tasks  
[Datasets, others](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#supported-file-types) | Varies | `container_upload` | Analyze data, create visualizations  
### 
Working with other file formats
For file types that are not supported as `document` blocks (.csv, .txt, .md, .docx, .xlsx), convert the files to plain text, and include the content directly in your message:
Shell
```
# Example: Reading a text file and sending it as plain text
# Note: For files with special characters, consider base64 encoding
TEXT_CONTENT=$(cat document.txt | jq -Rs .)

curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d @- <<EOF

  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "max_tokens": 1024,
  "messages": [

      "role": "user",
      "content": [

          "type": "text",
          "text": "Here's the document content:\n\n${TEXT_CONTENT}\n\nPlease summarize this document."





EOF
```

For .docx files containing images, convert them to PDF format first, then use [PDF support](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support) to take advantage of the built-in image parsing. This allows using citations from the PDF document.
#### 
Document blocks
For PDFs and text files, use the `document` content block:
```

  "type": "document",
  "source": {
    "type": "file",
    "file_id": "file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w"
  },
  "title": "Document Title", // Optional
  "context": "Context about the document", // Optional  
  "citations": {"enabled": true} // Optional, enables citations

```

#### 
Image blocks
For images, use the `image` content block:
```

  "type": "image",
  "source": {
    "type": "file",
    "file_id": "file_011CPMxVD3fHLUhvTqtsQA5w"


```

### 
Managing files
#### 
List files
Retrieve a list of your uploaded files:
Shell
```
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14"
```

#### 
Get file metadata
Retrieve information about a specific file:
Shell
```
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files/file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14"
```

#### 
Delete a file
Remove a file from your workspace:
Shell
```
curl -X DELETE https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files/file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14"
```

### 
Downloading a file
Download files that have been created by skills or the code execution tool:
Shell
```
curl -X GET "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files/file_011CNha8iCJcU1wXNR6q4V8w/content" \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: files-api-2025-04-14" \
  --output downloaded_file.txt
```

You can only download files that were created by [skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide) or the [code execution tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool). Files that you uploaded cannot be downloaded.
## 
File storage and limits
### 
Storage limits
  * **Maximum file size:** 500 MB per file
  * **Total storage:** 100 GB per organization


### 
File lifecycle
  * Files are scoped to the workspace of the API key. Other API keys can use files created by any other API key associated with the same workspace
  * Files persist until you delete them
  * Deleted files cannot be recovered
  * Files are inaccessible via the API shortly after deletion, but they may persist in active `Messages` API calls and associated tool uses
  * Files that users delete will be deleted in accordance with our [data retention policy](https://privacy.claude.com/en/articles/7996866-how-long-do-you-store-my-organization-s-data).


## 
Error handling
Common errors when using the Files API include:
  * **File not found (404):** The specified `file_id` doesn't exist or you don't have access to it
  * **Invalid file type (400):** The file type doesn't match the content block type (e.g., using an image file in a document block)
  * **Exceeds context window size (400):** The file is larger than the context window size (e.g. using a 500 MB plaintext file in a `/v1/messages` request)
  * **Invalid filename (400):** Filename doesn't meet the length requirements (1-255 characters) or contains forbidden characters (`<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `|`, `?`, `*`, `\`, `/`, or unicode characters 0-31)
  * **File too large (413):** File exceeds the 500 MB limit
  * **Storage limit exceeded (403):** Your organization has reached the 100 GB storage limit
