**The Admin API is unavailable for individual accounts.** To collaborate with teammates and add members, set up your organization in **Console → Settings → Organization**.
The [Admin API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/admin) allows you to programmatically manage your organization's resources, including organization members, workspaces, and API keys. This provides programmatic control over administrative tasks that would otherwise require manual configuration in the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/).
**The Admin API requires special access**
The Admin API requires a special Admin API key (starting with `sk-ant-admin...`) that differs from standard API keys. Only organization members with the admin role can provision Admin API keys through the Claude Console.
## 
How the Admin API works
When you use the Admin API:
  1. You make requests using your Admin API key in the `x-api-key` header
  2. The API allows you to manage: 
     * Organization members and their roles
     * Organization member invites
     * Workspaces and their members
     * API keys


This is useful for:
  * Automating user onboarding/offboarding
  * Programmatically managing workspace access
  * Monitoring and managing API key usage


## 
Organization roles and permissions
There are five organization-level roles. See more details [here](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10186004-api-console-roles-and-permissions).
Role | Permissions  
---|---  
user | Can use Workbench  
claude_code_user | Can use Workbench and [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview)  
developer | Can use Workbench and manage API keys  
billing | Can use Workbench and manage billing details  
admin | Can do all of the above, plus manage users  
##

  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

```

  "id": "12345678-1234-5678-1234-567812345678",
  "type": "organization",
  "name": "Organization Name"

```
