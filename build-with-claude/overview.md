Core capabilities
These features enhance Claude's fundamental abilities for processing, analyzing, and generating content across various formats and use cases.
Feature | Description | Availability  
---|---|---  
[1M token context window](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) | An extended context window that allows you to process much larger documents, maintain longer conversations, and work with more extensive codebases. |  Claude API (Beta)Amazon Bedrock (Beta)Google Cloud's Vertex AI (Beta)Microsoft Foundry (Beta)  
[Agent Skills](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) | Extend Claude's capabilities with Skills. Use pre-built Skills (PowerPoint, Excel, Word, PDF) or create custom Skills with instructions and scripts.

Supports clearing tool results when approaching token limits and managing thinking blocks in extended thinking conversations. |  Claude API (Beta)Amazon Bedrock (Beta)Google Cloud's Vertex AI (Beta)Microsoft Foundry (Beta)  
Control how many tokens Claude uses when responding with the effort parameter, trading off between response thoroughness and token efficiency. |  Claude API (Beta)Amazon Bedrock (Beta)Google Cloud's Vertex AI (Beta)Microsoft Foundry (Beta)  
[Extended thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) | Enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks, providing transparency into Claude's step-by-step thought process before delivering its final answer. |  Claude APIAmazon BedrockGoogle Cloud's Vertex AIMicrosoft Foundry  
Upload and manage files to use with Claude without re-uploading content with each request. Supports PDFs, images, and text files. |  Claude API (Beta)Microsoft Foundry (Beta)  
[PDF support](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support) | Process and analyze text and visual content from PDF documents. |  Claude APIAmazon BedrockGoogle Cloud's Vertex AIMicrosoft Foundry

[Prompt caching (1hr)](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#1-hour-cache-duration) | Extended 1-hour cache duration for less frequently accessed but important context, complementing the standard 5-minute cache. |  Claude APIMicrosoft Foundry  
[Search results](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/search-results) | Enable natural citations for RAG applications by providing search results with proper source attribution. Achieve web search-quality citations for custom knowledge bases and tools. |  Claude APIAmazon BedrockGoogle Cloud's Vertex AIMicrosoft Foundry  
[Structured outputs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs) | Guarantee schema conformance with two approaches: JSON outputs for structured data responses, and strict tool use for validated tool inputs. Available on Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.5, and Haiku 4.5. |  Claude APIAmazon Bedrock (Beta)Microsoft Foundry (Beta)  
[Token counting](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages-count-tokens) | Token counting enables you to determine the number of tokens in a message before sending it to Claude, helping you make informed decisions about your prompts and usage. |  Claude APIAmazon BedrockGoogle Cloud's Vertex AIMicrosoft Foundry  
Enable Claude to interact with external tools and APIs to perform a wider variety of tasks. For a list of supported tools, see [the Tools table](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/overview#tools). |  Claude APIAmazon BedrockGoogle Cloud's Vertex AIMicrosoft Foundry  
## 
Tools
