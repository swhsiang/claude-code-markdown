While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
Examples are your secret weapon shortcut for getting Claude to generate exactly what you need. By providing a few well-crafted examples in your prompt, you can dramatically improve the accuracy, consistency, and quality of Claude's outputs. This technique, known as few-shot or multishot prompting, is particularly effective for tasks that require structured outputs or adherence to specific formats.
**Power up your prompts** : Include 3-5 diverse, relevant examples to show Claude exactly what you want. More examples = better performance, especially for complex tasks.
## 
Why use examples?
  * **Accuracy** : Examples reduce misinterpretation of instructions.
  * **Consistency** : Examples enforce uniform structure and style.
  * **Performance** : Well-chosen examples boost Claude's ability to handle complex tasks.


## 
Crafting effective examples
For maximum effectiveness, make sure that your examples are:
  * **Relevant** : Your examples mirror your actual use case.
  * **Diverse** : Your examples cover edge cases and potential challenges, and vary enough that Claude doesn't inadvertently pick up on unintended patterns.
  * **Clear** : Your examples are wrapped in `<example>` tags (if multiple, nested within `<examples>` tags) for structure.


Ask Claude to evaluate your examples for relevance, diversity, or clarity. Or have Claude generate more examples based on your initial set.
