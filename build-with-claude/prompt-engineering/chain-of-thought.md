While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
When faced with complex tasks like research, analysis, or problem-solving, giving Claude space to think can dramatically improve its performance. This technique, known as chain of thought (CoT) prompting, encourages Claude to break down problems step-by-step, leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs.
## 
Before implementing CoT
### 
Why let Claude think?
  * **Accuracy:** Stepping through problems reduces errors, especially in math, logic, analysis, or generally complex tasks.
  * **Coherence:** Structured thinking leads to more cohesive, well-organized responses.
  * **Debugging:** Seeing Claude's thought process helps you pinpoint where prompts may be unclear.


### 
Why not let Claude think?
  * Increased output length may impact latency.
  * Not all tasks require in-depth thinking. Use CoT judiciously to ensure the right balance of performance and latency.


Use CoT for tasks that a human would need to think through, like complex math, multi-step analysis, writing complex documents, or decisions with many factors.
## 
How to prompt for thinking
The chain of thought techniques below are **ordered from least to most complex**. Less complex methods take up less space in the context window, but are also generally less powerful.
**CoT tip** : Always have Claude output its thinking. Without outputting its thought process, no thinking occurs!
  * **Basic prompt** : Include "Think step-by-step" in your prompt. 
    * Lacks guidance on _how_ to think (which is especially not ideal if a task is very specific to your app, use case, or organization)
### Example: Writing donor emails (basic CoT)
  * **Guided prompt** : Outline specific steps for Claude to follow in its thinking process. 
    * Lacks structuring to make it easy to strip out and separate the answer from the thinking.
### Example: Writing donor emails (guided CoT)
  * **Structured prompt** : Use XML tags like `<thinking>` and `<answer>` to separate reasoning from the final answer.

Examples
### Example: Financial analysis without thinking
### Example: Financial analysis with thinking
