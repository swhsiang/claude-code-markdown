While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
When using Claude, you can dramatically improve its performance by using the `system` parameter to give it a role. This technique, known as role prompting, is the most powerful way to use system prompts with Claude.
The right role can turn Claude from a general assistant into your virtual domain expert!
**System prompt tips** : Use the `system` parameter to set Claude's role. Put everything else, like task-specific instructions, in the `user` turn instead.
## 
Why use role prompting?
  * **Enhanced accuracy:** In complex scenarios like legal analysis or financial modeling, role prompting can significantly boost Claude's performance.
  * **Tailored tone:** Whether you need a CFO's brevity or a copywriter's flair, role prompting adjusts Claude's communication style.
  * **Improved focus:** By setting the role context, Claude stays more within the bounds of your task's specific requirements.


## 
How to give Claude a role
Use the `system` parameter in the [Messages API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages) to set Claude's role:
```
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    max_tokens=2048,
    system="You are a seasoned data scientist at a Fortune 500 company.", # <-- role prompt
    messages=[
"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this dataset for anomalies: <dataset>{{DATASET}}</dataset>"}



print(response.content)
```

**Role prompting tip** : Experiment with roles! A `data scientist` might see different insights than a `marketing strategist` for the same data. A `data scientist specializing in customer insight analysis for Fortune 500 companies` might yield different results still!

Examples
### 
Example 1: Legal contract analysis
Without a role, Claude might miss critical issues:
### Legal contract analysis without role prompting
With a role, Claude catches critical issues that could cost millions:
### Legal contract analysis with role prompting
### 
Example 2: Financial analysis
Without a role, Claude's analysis lacks depth:
### Financial analysis without role prompting
With a role, Claude delivers actionable insights:
### Financial analysis with role prompting
