While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?
Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.
## 
Why chain prompts?
  1. **Accuracy** : Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors.
  2. **Clarity** : Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
  3. **Traceability** : Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.


## 
When to chain prompts
Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps.
**Remember:** Each link in the chain gets Claude's full attention!
**Debugging tip** : If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.
## 
How to chain prompts
  1. **Identify subtasks** : Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
  2. **Structure with XML for clear handoffs** : Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
  3. **Have a single-task goal** : Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
  4. **Iterate** : Refine subtasks based on Claude's performance.


### 
Example chained workflows:
  * **Multi-step analysis** : See the legal and business examples below.
  * **Content creation pipelines** : Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
  * **Data processing** : Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
  * **Decision-making** : Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
  * **Verification loops** : Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.


**Optimization tip** : For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.
### 
Advanced: Self-correction chains
You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.
### Example: Self-correcting research summary
## 
Examples
### Example: Analyzing a legal contract (without chaining)
### Example: Analyzing a legal contract (with chaining)
### Example: Multitenancy strategy review
