While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.
**XML tip** : Use tags like `<instructions>`, `<example>`, and `<formatting>` to clearly separate different parts of your prompt. This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions with examples or context.
## 
Why use XML tags?
  * **Clarity:** Clearly separate different parts of your prompt and ensure your prompt is well structured.
  * **Accuracy:** Reduce errors caused by Claude misinterpreting parts of your prompt.
  * **Flexibility:** Easily find, add, remove, or modify parts of your prompt without rewriting everything.
  * **Parseability:** Having Claude use XML tags in its output makes it easier to extract specific parts of its response by post-processing.


There are no canonical "best" XML tags that Claude has been trained with in particular, although we recommend that your tag names make sense with the information they surround.
## 
Tagging best practices
  1. **Be consistent** : Use the same tag names throughout your prompts, and refer to those tag names when talking about the content (e.g, `Using the contract in <contract> tags...`).
  2. **Nest tags** : You should nest tags `<outer><inner></inner></outer>` for hierarchical content.


**Power user tip** : Combine XML tags with other techniques like multishot prompting (`<examples>`) or chain of thought (`<thinking>`, `<answer>`). This creates super-structured, high-performance prompts.
### 
Examples
### Example: Generating financial reports
### Example: Legal contract analysis
