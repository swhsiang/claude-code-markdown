Workspaces provide a way to organize your API usage within an organization. Use workspaces to separate different projects, environments, or teams while maintaining centralized billing and administration.
## 
How workspaces work
Every organization has a **Default Workspace** that cannot be renamed, archived, or deleted. When you create additional workspaces, you can assign API keys, members, and resource limits to each one.
Key characteristics:
  * **Workspace identifiers** use the `wrkspc_` prefix (e.g., `wrkspc_01JwQvzr7rXLA5AGx3HKfFUJ`)
  * **Maximum 100 workspaces** per organization (archived workspaces don't count)
  * **Default Workspace** has no ID and doesn't appear in list endpoints
  * **API keys** are scoped to a single workspace and can only access resources within that workspace


## 
Workspace roles and permissions
Members can have different roles in each workspace, allowing fine-grained access control.
Role | Permissions  
---|---  
Workspace User | Use the Workbench only  
Workspace Developer | Create and manage API keys, use the API  
Workspace Admin | Full control over workspace settings and members  
Workspace Billing | View workspace billing information (inherited from organization billing role)  
### 
Role inheritance
  * **Organization admins** automatically receive Workspace Admin access to all workspaces
  * **Organization billing members** automatically receive Workspace Billing access to all workspaces
  * **Organization users and developers** must be explicitly added to each workspace


The Workspace Billing role cannot be manually assigned. It's inherited from having the organization billing role.
## 
Managing workspaces
Only organization admins can create workspaces. Organization users and developers must be added to workspaces by an admin.
### 
Via the Console
Create and manage workspaces in the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/settings/workspaces).
#### 
Create a workspace
  1. 1
Open workspace settings
In the Claude Console, go to **Settings > Workspaces**.
  2. 2
Add a new workspace
Click **Add Workspace**.
  3. 3
Configure the workspace
Enter a workspace name and select a color for visual identification.
  4. 4
Create the workspace
Click **Create** to finalize.


To switch between workspaces in the Console, use the **Workspaces** selector in the top-left corner.
#### 
Edit workspace details
To modify a workspace's name or color:
  1. Select the workspace from the list
  2. Click the ellipsis menu (**...**) and choose **Edit details**
  3. Update the name or color and save your changes


The Default Workspace cannot be renamed or deleted.
#### 
Add members to a workspace
  1. Navigate to the workspace's **Members** tab
  2. Click **Add to Workspace**
  3. Select an organization member and assign them a [workspace role](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/workspaces#workspace-roles-and-permissions)
  4. Confirm the addition


To remove a member, click the trash icon next to their name.
Organization admins and billing members cannot be removed from workspaces while they hold those organization roles.
#### 
Set workspace limits
In the **Limits** tab, you can configure:
  * **Rate limits** : Set limits per model tier for requests per minute, input tokens, or output tokens
  * **Spend notifications** : Configure alerts when spending reaches certain thresholds


#### 
Archive a workspace
To archive a workspace, click the ellipsis menu (**...**) and select **Archive**. Archiving:
  * Preserves historical data for reporting
  * Deactivates the workspace and all associated API keys
  * Cannot be undone


Archiving a workspace immediately revokes all API keys in that workspace. This action cannot be undone.
### 
Via the Admin API
Programmatically manage workspaces using the [Admin API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/administration-api).
Admin API endpoints require an Admin API key (starting with `sk-ant-admin...`) that differs from standard API keys. Only organization members with the admin role can provision Admin API keys through the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/settings/admin-keys).
```
# Create a workspace
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{"name": "Production"}'

# List workspaces
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces?limit=10&include_archived=false" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"

# Archive a workspace
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/archive" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see the [Workspaces API reference](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/admin-api/workspaces/get-workspace).
### 
Managing workspace members
Add, update, or remove members from a workspace:
```
# Add a member to a workspace
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{
    "user_id": "user_xxx",
    "workspace_role": "workspace_developer"
  }'

# Update a member's role
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{"workspace_role": "workspace_admin"}'

# Remove a member from a workspace
curl --request DELETE "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/workspaces/{workspace_id}/members/{user_id}" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

For complete parameter details, see the [Workspace Members API reference](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/admin-api/workspace_members/get-workspace-member).
## 
API keys and resource scoping
API keys are scoped to a specific workspace. When you create an API key in a workspace, it can only access resources within that workspace.
Resources scoped to workspaces include:
  * **Files** created via the [Files API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/files)
  * **Message Batches** created via the [Batch API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing)
  * **Skills** created via the [Skills API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide)


Starting February 5, 2026, [prompt caches](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) will also be isolated per workspace (applies to the Claude API and Azure only).
To retrieve your organization's workspace IDs, use the [List Workspaces](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/admin-api/workspaces/list-workspaces) endpoint, or find them in the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/settings/workspaces).
## 
Workspace limits
You can set custom spend and rate limits for each workspace to protect against overuse and ensure fair resource distribution.
### 
Setting workspace limits
Workspace limits can be set lower than (but not higher than) your organization's limits:
  * **Spend limits** : Cap monthly spending for a workspace
  * **Rate limits** : Limit requests per minute, input tokens per minute, or output tokens per minute


  * You cannot set limits on the Default Workspace
  * If not set, workspace limits match the organization's limits
  * Organization-wide limits always apply, even if workspace limits add up to more


For detailed information on rate limits and how they work, see [Rate limits](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/rate-limits).
## 
Usage and cost tracking
Track usage and costs by workspace using the [Usage and Cost API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/usage-cost-api):
```
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/usage_report/messages?\
starting_at=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&\
ending_at=2025-01-08T00:00:00Z&\
workspace_ids[]=wrkspc_01JwQvzr7rXLA5AGx3HKfFUJ&\
group_by[]=workspace_id&\
bucket_width=1d" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

Usage and costs attributed to the Default Workspace have a `null` value for `workspace_id`.
## 
Common use cases
### 
Environment separation
Create separate workspaces for development, staging, and production:
Workspace | Purpose  
---|---  
Development | Testing and experimentation with lower rate limits  
Staging | Pre-production testing with production-like limits  
Production | Live traffic with full rate limits and monitoring  
### 
Team or department isolation
Assign workspaces to different teams for cost allocation and access control:
  * **Engineering team** with developer access
  * **Data science team** with their own API keys
  * **Support team** with limited access for customer tools


### 
Project-based organization
Create workspaces for specific projects or products to track usage and costs separately.
## 
Best practices
  1. 1
Plan your workspace structure
Consider how you'll organize workspaces before creating them. Think about billing, access control, and usage tracking needs.
  2. 2
Use meaningful names
Name workspaces clearly to indicate their purpose (e.g., "Production - Customer Chatbot", "Dev - Internal Tools").
  3. 3
Set appropriate limits
Configure spend and rate limits to prevent unexpected costs and ensure fair resource distribution.
  4. 4
Audit access regularly
Review workspace membership periodically to ensure only appropriate users have access.
  5. 5
Monitor usage
Use the [Usage and Cost API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/usage-cost-api) to track workspace-level consumption.
