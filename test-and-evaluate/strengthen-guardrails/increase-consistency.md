**For guaranteed JSON schema conformance**
If you need Claude to always output valid JSON that conforms to a specific schema, use [Structured Outputs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs) instead of the prompt engineering techniques below. Structured outputs provide guaranteed schema compliance and are specifically designed for this use case.
The techniques below are useful for general output consistency or when you need flexibility beyond strict JSON schemas.
Here's how to make Claude's responses more consistent:
## 
Specify the desired output format
Precisely define your desired output format using JSON, XML, or custom templates so that Claude understands every output formatting element you require.
### Example: Standardizing customer feedback
## 
Prefill Claude's response
Prefill the `Assistant` turn with your desired format. This trick bypasses Claude's friendly preamble and enforces your structure.
### Example: Daily sales report
## 
Constrain with examples
Provide examples of your desired output. This trains Claude's understanding better than abstract instructions.
### Example: Generating consistent market intelligence
## 
Use retrieval for contextual consistency
For tasks requiring consistent context (e.g., chatbots, knowledge bases), use retrieval to ground Claude's responses in a fixed information set.
### Example: Enhancing IT support consistency
## 
Chain prompts for complex tasks
Break down complex tasks into smaller, consistent subtasks. Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing inconsistency errors across scaled workflows.
